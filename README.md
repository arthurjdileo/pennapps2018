A peer to peer system to enable victims of natural disaster to quickly contact first responders without the need for WiFi or Cellular Data

# What it does
This application is mainly used by the layperson who would be in a natural disaster or other hazardous situation. At the userâ€™s discretion, the app collects medical records such as weight, height, and special conditions and pairs them with a last-known GPS location and a picture of the user. If the user is trapped or in danger after the natural disaster, the app will make a single file with all of this information so first responders can rescue civilians faster with this important information. Because this is a bluetooth messaging system, internet and cellular reception is not needed.

# What is next
We will develop the application further and streamline the experience. Regardless if this application would gain traction, the opportunity to learn app development and express oneself is an excellent benefit. For the future, we are planning to use the RedSave Clientele to daisy chain the current process we have to allow more people to be put into contact with the distressed.
